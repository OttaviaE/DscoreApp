# DscoreApp (v0.1)

A Shiny Web Application for computing the IAT D-score. 

This app is meant as an easy and open source alternative for computing the IAT 
D-score.

DscoreApp can also be used online, and it is retriavable at the URL: http://fisppa.psy.unipd.it/DscoreApp/

If you want to use the app locally on your computer, you have to set the 
directory on LINE 23 in `server.R` to your working directory (if you want to use
the example dataset).
